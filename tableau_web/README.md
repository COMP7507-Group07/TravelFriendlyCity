# Introduction
This is the web application using for Visual7507 in 2023 group 7 demo pre. We just put the UI framework into the file, in case you don't have node.js and npm. There is no other tableau file because we published our work into tableau public and linked them with URLs.

# Usage
Using vscode extension Go-live is ok. Just make sure you are under the top dictionary tableau_web, and go to URL:

    localhost:5500
